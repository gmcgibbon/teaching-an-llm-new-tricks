            ## LLM?

            ![Developer Thinking](images/developer-thinking.png)

            Note:
            - How many of you know what an LLM is?
            - How many of you have used one?
            - How many of you have use them daily?
            ---
            ## What is an LLM?

            A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of AI that uses deep learning to understand and generate human language.

            Note:
            - Large Language Models are a kind of Artifical Intelligence
            - that understands and generates human language
            ---
            ## What is an LLM?

            - ChatGPT
            - Claude
            - Gemini

            Note:
            - Some examples of LLMs are
            - ChatGPT from OpenAI
            - Claude from Anthropic
            - Gemini from Google
            ---
            ## AI is Everywhere

            # ðŸŒŽ

            Note:
            - LLMs are everywhere these days
            - It has seeped into my day-to-day work
            - I have mixed feelings
            ---
            ## AI is Everywhere

            ![LLM using MCP but Wrong](images/fail.png)

            Note:
            - I used it to help write this presentation
            - And to ocasionally provide visuals
            - Some better than others
            ---
            ## AI is Everywhere

            ![LLM using MCP but Wrong](images/fail.png)

            Note:
            - I see the value of it
            - It can do amazing things
            - But I worry about how it is being used
            ---
            ## The future I wanted

            - Automation of repetitive tasks
            - Code autocompletion
            - A competent pair programmer

            Note:
            - I thought AI could solve job pain points
            - Automate repetitive tasks
            - Code autocompletion
            - A knowledgable pair programmer
            ---
            ## The future I got

            - Vibe coding
            - Intern level code competence
            - AI-generated hallucinations

            Note:
            - But what we have today is different
            - Vibe coding
            - Intern level autocomplete and code reviews
            - AI-generated hallucinations
            ---
            ## What people say

            ![Developers Talking](images/developers-talking.png)

            Note:
            - I've heard a lot of people say negative things about AI
            - It makes our brains slower
            - It makes development slower
            - It is bad for the environment
            ---
            ## What people say

            ![Developers Talking](images/developers-talking.png)

            Note:
            - This all sounds pretty bad
            - But is it true?
            ---
            ## What studies say

            ![Your Brain on Chat GPT](images/your-brain-on-chat-gpt.png)

            Note:
            - A study from MIT found
            - ChatGPT can impact critical thinking
            - At least in the context of essay writing
            ---
            ## What studies say

            ![Measuring the Impact of AI Tools 2025](images/measuring-the-impact-of-early-2025-ai.png)

            Note:
            - Another study from MIT found
            - The AI tools developers use today
            - Make us slower, not faster
            ---
            ## What studies say

            ![AI Datacenters Causing Distortions](images/ai-data-centers-causing-distortions.png)

            Note:
            - An article from Bloomberg found
            - AI data centers are causing problems
            - In the US power grid
            ---

            ![Out of touch](images/out-of-touch.jpg)

            Note:
            - I might be being too negative
            - I'm sure we used to feel this way about calculators
            - Or spell check
            - Or even bitcoin
            ---

            ![Out of touch](images/out-of-touch.jpg)

            Note:
            - Maybe I'm just out of touch
            - It is easy to focus on the negatives
            - But there are positives too
            ---
            ## AI Assistants

            ![Siri](images/siri-iphone.jpg)

            Note:
            - Big tech companies all offer AI assistants
            - If you can get past spying
            - They're useful for timers, weather, etc.
            ---
            ## AI Assistants

            ![Siri](images/siri-iphone.jpg)

            Note:
            - Apple has Siri
            - But there are other offerings too
            - As you probably know
            ---
            ## Reading and Writing

            ![Text Summarization](images/text-summary.png)

            Note:
            - Modern LLMs are pretty good at reading/writing
            - Many people use it to summarize text or write for them
            - Though you can often tell if text is AI generated
            ---
            ## Reading and Writing

            ![Text Summarization](images/text-summary.png)

            Note:
            - Here I'm asking it to summarize the Ruby Wikipedia page
            - It seems to do a good job
            ---
            ## Search

            ![Chatbot](images/chatbot.png)

            Note:
            - LLMs are also pretty good at search
            - They can use Retreival Augmented Generation
            - To learn about specific data sources
            ---
            ## Search

            ![Chatbot](images/chatbot.png)

            Note:
            - I don't have a lot of experience with chatbots
            - But Intercom's chatbot is pretty good
            - I asked it how to make API calls with Ruby
            ---
            ## Search

            ![Chatbot](images/chatbot.png)

            Note:
            - It pointed me to the Rails gem
            - Not the Ruby gem
            - But it was still helpful
            ---
            ## Coding

            ![Cursor](images/cursor.png)

            Note:
            - I bashed AI generated code earlier but
            - Editors like Cursor are interesting
            - You can tell an LLM to do your job for you
            - But it probably won't do it well. Yet.
            ---
            ## Coding

            ![Cursor](images/cursor.png)

            Note:
            - Other editors are catching up
            - VS Code has Copilot
            - JetBrains has Junie
            ---
            ## The LLM Client

            ![ChatGPT Website](images/chatgpt-web.png)

            Note:
            - We usually use some kind of client
            - To interact with an LLM
            - This can be a webpage, mobile app, your editor, etc.
            ---
            ## The LLM Client

            ![ChatGPT Website](images/chatgpt-web.png)

            Note:
            - One that we're all familiar with
            - Is the ChatGPT website
            - It provides a front end with a chat interface
            ---
            ## The LLM Client

            ![VS Code AI Prompt](images/vs-code-ai-prompt.png)

            Note:
            - VS Code also has an LLM client built in
            - I'll use this later in the demo
            - Let's look at how it works under the hood
            ---
            ## The LLM Client

            ```mermaid
            graph LR
              Developer -- Chats --> Client
              Client -- Queries --> LLM
              LLM -- Responds --> Client
            ```

            Note:
            - Explain diagram
            ---
            ## The LLM Client

            ![VS Code Agent Select](images/vs-code-agent-select.png)

            Note:
            - Often you can choose the LLM to query
            - LLMs are often referred to as Agents
            - But they are just a target LLM version
            - Like Calude 3.5 or GPT 4
            ---
            ## The LLM Client

            ![VS Code Chat Select](images/vs-code-chat-select.png)

            Note:
            - It can also manage conversations
            - Which allows you talk to multiple models
            - And keep the context in threads
            ---
            ## New Skills

            ![VS Code AI Prompt](images/vs-code-ai-prompt.png)

            Note:
            - We know roughly how clients talk to LLMs
            - How do we teach them new skills?
            ---
            ## New Skills

            ![VS Code AI Prompt](images/vs-code-ai-prompt.png)

            Note:
            - Alexa can play music from Spotify
            - Siri can send messages on your behalf
            - Can I teach ChatGPT to talk to a Rails Application?
            ---
            ## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

            ![Model Context Protocol Logo](images/mcp.svg)

            Note:
            - Yes, you can
            - And that's what I'd like to talk about today
            - Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standard way
            - For clients to extend the capabilities of LLMs
            ---
            ## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

            ```mermaid
            graph LR
              Client <-- Registers --> MCPServer
              Client -- Queries --> MCPServer
              MCPServer -- Responds --> Client
            ```

            Note:
            - It works like this
            - Explain diagram
            ---
            ## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

            ```mermaid
            sequenceDiagram
              Client ->> Server: Initialize Request
              activate Server
              Server -->> Client: Initialize Response
              Server -->> Client: Initialized Notification
              deactivate Server
            ```

            Note:
            - When registering a new MCP Server
            - The client starts a handshake
            - Explain diagram
            ---
            ## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

            ```json
            {
              "jsonrpc": "2.0",
              "id": 1,
              "method": "initialize",
              "params": {
                "protocolVersion": "2025-06-18",
                "capabilities": {
                  "sampling": {},
                },
                "clientInfo": {
                  "name": "client", "title": "Client", "version": "0.0.1"
                }
              }
            }
            ```

            Note:
            - Requests, responses, and notifications
            - Are all sent as JSON RPC
            - This is what the initialize request looks like
            - Explain JSON
            ---
            ## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

            ```json
            {
              "jsonrpc": "2.0",
              "id": 1,
              "result": {
                "protocolVersion": "2025-06-18",
                "capabilities": {
                  "tools": { "listChanged": true }
                },
                "serverInfo": {
                  "name": "server", "title": "Server", "version": "0.0.1"
                }
              }
            }
            ```

            Note:
            - The initialize response looks similar
            - Explain JSON
            ---
            ## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

            ```json
            {
              "jsonrpc": "2.0",
              "method": "notifications/initialized"
            }
            ```

            Note:
            - Notifications looks like this
            - And are sent through HTTP streaming
            - Which is basically a long-lived HTTP request
            ---
            ## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

            ```json
            {
              "jsonrpc": "2.0",
              "method": "notifications/initialized"
            }
            ```

            Note:
            - When the initialized notification is received
            - The handshsake is done
            - The client and server can now communicate
            ---
            ## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

            ```json
            {

              "params": {}
            }
            ```

            Note:
            - The client then usually asks the server
            - For a list of tools it has
            - Based on stated capabilities
            - Tools are basically remote functions

              "id": 1,
              "result": {
                "tools": [
                  {
                    "name": "test", "description": "Test", "inputSchema": {
                      "type": "object",
                      "properties": {
                        "name": { "type": "string", "description": "Name"}
                      },
                      "required": ["name"]
                    }
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
            ```

            Note:
            - The server responds with a list of tools
            - Here we have a test tool
            - With a name parameter

              Client -- Queries with Tools --> LLM
              LLM -- Responds --> Client
            ```

            Note:
            - At this point the client knows
            - What the server can do
            - Explain diagram

                "strict": true
              }]
            }
            ```

            Note:
            - And that would look like this
            - Explain JSON
            ---
            ## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

            ```json
            {
              "jsonrpc": "2.0",
              "id": 1,
              "method": "tools/call",
              "params": { "name":"test", "arguments": { "name":"Gannon" } }
            }
            ```

            Note:
            - If the LLM wishes
            - The client can then call a tool
            - By sending a tools/call request
            - With the name of the tool and arguments
            ---
            ## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

            ```json
            {
              "jsonrpc": "2.0",
              "id": 1,
              "result": {
                "content": [{
                  "type": "text",
                  "text": "Hello from MCP, Gannon"
                }],
                "isError": false
              }
            }
            ```

            Note:
            - The server responds with a result with content
            - The content is the return from the tool
            ---
            ## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

            - Tools
            - Resources
            - Prompts

            Note:
            - Tools are just one server capability
            - There's also prompts and resources
            - Resources are files hosted on the server
            - Prompts are basically templated queries
            ---
            ## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

            - Roots
            - Sampling
            - Elicitation

            Note:
            - Clients also have capabilities too
            - I'm focusing more on MCP servers
            - So you can read more about that in the MCP spec

              Client -->> Server: Disconnect
              deactivate Server
            ```

            Note:
            - When the client no longer wishes to use the server
            - It can simply close the connection
            - No disconnect request is needed
            ---
            ## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

            - HTTP
            - STDIO

            Note:
            - HTTP is just a transport method
            - You can also use MCP servers through STDIO
            - Anything that you can send and receive JSON through
            ---
            ## Demo

            Note:
            - Demo
            - Building a basic MCP server
            - VSCode and Ruby
            - Using Copilot
            ---
            ## API Clients

            ![MCP SDKs](images/sdks.png)

            Note:
            - Not all of us are Rubyists
            - There's a standard set of SDKs
            - Ruby's SDK isn't quite production ready, but other clients likely are
            ---
            ## Be Careful

            ![Developer and AI High Fiving](images/high-five.png)

            Note:
            - LLMs are really cool
            - But they are a developing technology
            - Error prone
            - You shouldn't trust them to do the right thing
            ---
            ## Be Careful

            ![Developer and AI High Fiving](images/high-five.png)

            Note:
            - They're getting better
            - They show a lot of promise
            - They might just take our jobs
            - But not anytime soon IMO
            ---
            ## Be Careful

            ![Developer and AI High Fiving](images/high-five.png)

            Note:
            - I've heard a sentiment that I agree with
            - LLMs are like interns
            - They can do basic work
            ---
            ## Be Careful

            ![Developer and AI High Fiving](images/high-five.png)

            Note:
            - You need to hold their hand a lot
            - They get a lot of things wrong
            - But they also might surpise you
